# Labyrinth generator configuration
# WIDTH: The number of cells in width
WIDTH = 20

# HEIGHT: The number of cells in height
HEIGHT = 15

# ENTRY: The coordinates (x,y) where the path starts
ENTRY = (0, 0)

# EXIT: The coordinates (x,y) where the path ends
# Note: Ensure these coordinates are within the limits (if width is 20, max x is 19)
EXIT = (19, 14)  # Example exit coordinates

# OUTPUT_FILE: The name of the file where your program will write the hexadecimal result
OUTPUT_FILE = "maze.txt"

# PERFECT: If True, there should be only one unique path between the entry and exit
PERFECT = True
